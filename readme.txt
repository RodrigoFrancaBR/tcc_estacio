Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of Spring Boot. It adds several production grade services to your application with little effort on your part. In this guide, you will build an application and then see how to add these services.

There are also many features added to your application for managing the service in a production (or other) environment. The business functionality of the service you build is the same as in Building a RESTful Web Service. You need need not use that guide to take advantage of this one, although it might be interesting to compare the results.
